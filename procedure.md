Procedure for the experiment is as follows:

1. Click/Tap on the **Start** button to start the experiment.
2. The water shall start decreasing in the container and start flowing through the flow channel.
3. The light will be projected along with the flow of water in the long pipe.
4. The path of the light will differ according to the flow type chosen. You can choose the desired flow type by choosing from **Choose flow type** drop-down menu.
5. Try to change the flow speed by using **Control flow speed** glider. Bringing the glider to the left will slow down the water flow whereas bringing it to the right will speed it up!
6. The **Control flow speed** glider is dynamic and can be changed midway when the water is flowing too. 
7. Click/Tap on the **Reset** button to restart the expeirment afresh, i.e., with empty apparatus.
