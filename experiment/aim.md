The purpose of this experiment is to illustrate the influence of Reynolds number on pipe flows. Reynolds number is a very useful dimensionless quantity (the ratio of dynamic forces to viscous forces) that aids in classifying certain flows. For incompressible flow in a pipe Reynolds number based on the pipe diameter, ReD = VaveDĎ/Îź, serves well. Generally, laminar flows correspond to ReD < 2100, transitional flows occur in the range 2100 < ReD < 4000, and turbulent flows exist for ReD > 4000. However, disturbances in the flow from various sources may cause the flow to deviate from this pattern. This experiment will illustrate laminar, transitional, and turbulent flows in a pipe.
