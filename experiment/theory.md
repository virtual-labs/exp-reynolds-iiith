**EQUIPMENTS:**
The flow of real fluids can basically occur under two very different regimes namely laminar and turbulent flow. The laminar flow is characterized by fluid particles moving in the form of lamina sliding over each other, such that at any instant the velocity at all the points in particular lamina is the same. The lamina near the flow boundary move at a slower rate as compared to those near the center of the flow passage. This type of flow occurs in viscous fluids, fluids moving at slow velocity and fluids flowing through narrow passages.

The turbulent flow is characterized by constant agitation and intermixing of fluid particles such that their velocity changes from point to point and even at the same point from time to time. This type of flow occurs in low density Fluids flow through wide passage and in high velocity flows.
Reynolds conducted an experiment for observation and determination of these regimes of flow. By introducing a fine filament of dye in to the flow of water through the glass tube, at its entrance he studied the different types of flow. At low velocities the dye filament appeared as straight line through the length of the tube and parallel to its axis, characterizing laminar flow. As the velocity is increased the dye filament becomes wavy throughout indicating transition flow. On further increasing the velocity the filament breaks up and diffuses completely in the water in the glass tube indicating the turbulent flow.
